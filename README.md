# Project Doohicky: Voice-Controlled ESP32 Audio Player with Azure OpenAI GPT-4 Integration

Project Doohicky is an innovative voice-controlled audio player that combines an ESP32 microcontroller, INMP441 microphone, MAX98357A audio amplifier, and a speaker to create an interactive audio experience. The project integrates with Azure OpenAI GPT-4 to provide natural language processing capabilities and generate contextually relevant responses.

## Features
- Upload and play WAV files through a web interface
- Record audio using the INMP441 microphone
- Process recorded audio with Azure OpenAI GPT-4
- Generate intelligent responses based on the recorded audio
- User-friendly web interface for easy interaction

## Hardware Components
- ESP32 WROOM-32 microcontroller
- INMP441 I2S digital microphone
- MAX98357A I2S audio amplifier
- 4 ohm, 3 watt speaker

## Software Components
- Arduino IDE
- ESP32 Arduino Core
- Azure Functions
- Azure OpenAI GPT-4
- Web technologies (HTML, CSS, JavaScript)

## Getting Started
1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/xboosty/voice-controlled-audio-player.git
   ```
2. Set up the hardware components as described in the project documentation.
3. Install the necessary software dependencies:
   - Arduino IDE
   - ESP32 Arduino Core
   - Azure CLI
   - Node.js
4. Configure the Azure OpenAI GPT-4 resource and obtain the API key and endpoint.
5. Update the configuration files with your Wi-Fi credentials, Azure OpenAI API key, and endpoint.
6. Upload the firmware to the ESP32 microcontroller using the Arduino IDE.
7. Deploy the Azure Functions code using the Azure CLI.
8. Access the web interface to interact with the voice-controlled audio player.
