This updated HowToUse.md file includes the necessary steps to set up and use the voice-controlled audio player with the ESP32, INMP441 microphone, MAX98357A amplifier, and Azure OpenAI GPT-4 integration. It covers the hardware setup, software setup, usage instructions, and troubleshooting tips.
Make sure to replace <your-function-app-name> with the actual name of your deployed Azure Functions app in the deployment step

In this updated code:
The main function retrieves the user's request from the query parameters.
The conversation history is initialized with a system message that instructs the assistant to continuously ask questions to engage the user in a conversation.
Inside a while loop, the code generates questions and responses using Azure OpenAI GPT-4 by sending the conversation history to the openai.ChatCompletion.create method.
The generated response from the assistant is added to the conversation history.
If the assistant's response is a question (i.e., ends with a question mark), it is returned to the user.
If the assistant's response is not a question, the code generates a follow-up question by appending a user message asking for a follow-up question to the conversation history and sending it to the openai.ChatCompletion.create method.
The generated follow-up question is added to the conversation history and returned to the user.
This code ensures that the GPT assistant continuously asks questions to engage the user in a conversation. The assistant will either ask a direct question or generate a follow-up question based on the previous conversation history.
Remember to update the openai.api_key and openai.api_base with your actual Azure OpenAI API key and endpoint, respectively.
Note: This code assumes that the user's request is provided as a query parameter named request. Make sure to modify the ESP32 firmware code to send the user's request accordingly.
